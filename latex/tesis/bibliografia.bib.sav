  abstract  = {Geometric graphs (topological graphs) are graphs drawn in the plane with possibly crossing straight-line edges (resp., curvilinear edges). Starting with a problem of Heinz Hopf and Erika Pannwitz from 1934 and a seminal paper of Paul Erd{\H{o}}s from 1946, we give a biased survey of Tur{\'a}n-type questions in the theory of geometric and topological graphs. What is the maximum number of edges that a geometric or topological graph of n vertices can have if it contains no forbidden subconfiguration of a certain type? We put special emphasis on open problems raised by Erd{\H{o}}s or directly motivated by his work.},
